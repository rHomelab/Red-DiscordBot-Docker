  --debuginfo           Show debug information.
  --list-instances      List all instance names setup with 'redbot-setup'
  --edit                Edit the instance. This can be done without console
                        interaction by passing --no-prompt and arguments that
                        you want to change (available arguments: --edit-
                        instance-name, --edit-data-path, --copy-data, --owner,
                        --token, --prefix).
  --edit-instance-name EDIT_INSTANCE_NAME
                        New name for the instance. This argument only works
                        with --edit argument passed.
  --overwrite-existing-instance
                        Confirm overwriting of existing instance when changing
                        name. This argument only works with --edit argument
                        passed.
  --edit-data-path EDIT_DATA_PATH
                        New data path for the instance. This argument only
                        works with --edit argument passed.
  --copy-data           Copy data from old location. This argument only works
                        with --edit and --edit-data-path arguments passed.
  --owner OWNER         ID of the owner. Only who hosts Red should be owner,
                        this has serious security implications if misused.
  --co-owner CO_OWNER [CO_OWNER ...]
                        ID of a co-owner. Only people who have access to the
                        system that is hosting Red should be co-owners, as
                        this gives them complete access to the system's data.
                        This has serious security implications if misused. Can
                        be multiple.
  --prefix PREFIX, -p PREFIX
                        Global prefix. Can be multiple
  --no-prompt           Disables console inputs. Features requiring console
                        interaction could be disabled as a result
  --no-cogs             Starts Red with no cogs loaded, only core
  --load-cogs LOAD_COGS [LOAD_COGS ...]
                        Force loading specified cogs from the installed
                        packages. Can be used with the --no-cogs flag to load
                        these cogs exclusively.
  --unload-cogs UNLOAD_COGS [UNLOAD_COGS ...]
                        Force unloading specified cogs.
  --dry-run             Makes Red quit with code 0 just before the login. This
                        is useful for testing the boot process.
  -v, --verbose, --debug
                        Increase the verbosity of the logs, each usage of this
                        flag increases the verbosity level by 1.
  --dev                 Enables developer mode
  --mentionable         Allows mentioning the bot as an alternative to using
                        the bot prefix
  --rpc                 Enables the built-in RPC server. Please read the docs
                        prior to enabling this!

  --no-instance         Run Red without any existing instance. The data will
                        be saved under a temporary folder and deleted on next
                        system restart.
  --team-members-are-owners, --team-developers-are-owners
                        Treat application team members as owners, if their
                        team role is Owner, Admin, or Developer. This is off
                        by default. Owners can load and run arbitrary code. Do
                        not enable if you would not trust all of your team
                        members with all of the data on the host machine.
  --message-cache-size MESSAGE_CACHE_SIZE
                        Set the maximum number of messages to store in the

                        Unsupported flag that allows disabling the given
                        intent. Currently NOT SUPPORTED (and not covered by
                        our version guarantees) as Red is not prepared to work
                        without all intents. Go to https://discordpy.readthedo
                        cs.io/en/v2.5.2/api.html#discord.Intents to see what
                        each intent does. This flag can be used multiple times
                        to specify multiple intents.
  --force-rich-logging  Forcefully enables the Rich logging handlers. This is
                        normally enabled for supported active terminals.
  --force-disable-rich-logging

                        after the executed line that should be shown in
                        tracebacks generated by Rich. Useful for development.

                        Enable showing local variables in tracebacks generated
                        by Rich. Useful for development.
